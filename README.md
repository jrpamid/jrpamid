## Hey ðŸ‘‹, I'm JP (Jagadish Pamidimalla)!
ðŸš€ DevOps and Site Reliability Engineering (SRE) Specialist | Trainer | Consultant

Passionate about automating everything, from CI/CD pipelines to full-stack infrastructures. I'm constantly optimizing for scalability and reliability, working across AWS, Kubernetes, Docker, and Terraform. 

**My Mission:** Deliver robust, automated solutions that streamline operations and enable developers to focus on code rather than infrastructure.
